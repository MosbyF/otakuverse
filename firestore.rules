/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and shelf items, while allowing public read access to anime, manga, and genre information.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, with 'userId' matching the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /anime/{animeId}: Stores anime series information. Publicly readable.
 * - /manga/{mangaId}: Stores manga series information. Publicly readable.
 * - /genres/{genreId}: Stores genre information. Publicly readable.
 * - /users/{userId}/shelfItems/{shelfItemId}: Stores items on a user's shelf, nested under the user's profile.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User profiles and shelf items are strictly owned by the user, based on their Firebase Auth UID. Only the owner can create, read, update, or delete these items.
 * - Anime, manga, and genre data are publicly readable but not writable through the client.
 * - The 'list' operation is allowed only for the owner of the `/users/{userId}/shelfItems/{shelfItemId}` collection.
